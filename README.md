# ZOOOOOP - File Transfer App

It is a web based application inspired by the hastle students face while transfering files from one device to another during online exams. The project aims at sending files of various formats and sizes, through devices connected on the local network. Sender can easily upload multiple files from its local machine and via the link/QR Code generated, the reciever can download the files. This project not only transfers files faster but also creates a one-stop solution by providing features such as easy connectivity between two devices and allowing reciever to convert multiple recieved images into a PDF format and then download the same.
